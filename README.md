# Project Title

Converting ICS/Ical events to Google Tasks.

## Description
This project allows you to convert events in ICS/Ical format into Google Tasks as to-do items. It simplifies the process of managing your tasks by integrating calendar events directly into your task list. This project was basically made for students using Canvas to import all their events as to-do list items. This is the Python version for the project, and we are in the process of launching a Chrome extension which will do it for you.
